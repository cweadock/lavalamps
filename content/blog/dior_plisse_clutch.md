Some bags I can find endless amounts of info and for some, there's almost nothing. This bag falls into the second category.

I came across this bag and it was unlike anything I'd ever seen, and apparently the internet felt the same.

From 1996 to 2011, John Galliano was the creative director at Dior, and one of the most iconic, known for both his ready to wear and haute couture collections. He was behind many of holy grail Dior designs, but many feel his theatrics crossed the line towards his personal style rather than staying true to Dior.

Through his many iconic silhouettes and collections, this bag comes to us via Dior Plisse, 2007 A/W. Characteristics of this bag include pleated and embroidered creamy leather, canvas CD-logo printed lining, and an enamel closure.
