Nocebo: said to occur when a patient's negative expectations for a treatment cause the treatment to have a worse effect that it otherwise would

Placebo: said to occur when positive expectations improve an outcome 

Both effects are psychogenic, meaning they originate from the mind but they can produce measurable physical effects on the body. While a placebo effect improves a condition, nocebo can produce a wide range of symptoms such as nausea, stomach pains, itching, bloating, depression, and sleep problems. 

While learning about the US National Radio Quiet Zone, I came across this phenomenon that is used to describe electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), which many of the residents in the quiet zone claim to suffer from. EHS is a prime example of the nocebo effect because in double blind studies where participants are exposed to real electromagnetic fields or told they are being exposed but are actually not, they are equally as likely to report symptoms. AKA, when they are told they should expect symptoms, they experience them. 

Another interesting example of a nocebo effect might be when patients are informed of possible side effects of drugs, they may develop these side effects simply from knowing they exist.
