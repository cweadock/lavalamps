Lava lamps is such a random name for a blog right? 

Perhaps they are the most random thing possible. This is precisely why Cloudflare, an internet security company, uses them to generate encryption keys.

Because computers can never really generate random numbers, you must look to the real world instead.

The lava blobs in lava lamps never take the same shape twice and move in inconsistent ways, not really following a pattern, similar to the way a candle flickers or a leaf blows in the wind. Cloudflare uses a series of cameras pointed at the lamps to generate data points (numbers) for starting points for their encryption keys.

This blog will follow that randomness of a lava lamp by documenting all the little tidbits I collect through various sources of media, never the same as the previous.
