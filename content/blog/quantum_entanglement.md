Quantum entanglement is a concept I came across in the TikTok comments of a post about how a couple met. According to some, falling in love and being in a relationship is similar to the mechanics of quantum entanglement. 

Quantum entanglement is "a complex phenomenon that is usually poorly described as an invisible link between distant quantum objects that allows one to instantly affect the other [Ferrie](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-entanglement-isnt-all-that-spooky-after-all1/). Einstein once described it as "spooky action at a distance" and was not a huge fan of quantum physics which was alledgedly solidified by a famous paper he helped write that claimed quantum physics was incomplete.

Another simple definition of it is "when two particles link together in a certain way no matter how far apart they are in space. A change induced in one will affect the other [Emspak](https://www.space.com/31933-quantum-entanglement-action-at-a-distance.html).
