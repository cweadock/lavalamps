Today's blog post is about Cozy Bear, which sounds really cute, but is actually is a Russian hacker group that is believed to be acting on behalf of Russia's foreign intelligence service (SVR). They are known by many names such as Cozykar, CozkRuke, Office Monkeys, and APT29. 

APT standing for advanced persistent threat, which describes threats that may lay undetected for a long time before acting and are often motivated politically or economically. "Dwell time" is the official term for how long these groups go undetected, with a median time in the Americas of 71 days. 
APT groups usually follow a similar lifecycle: 
1. Initial compromise - using social engineering and phishing attacks 
2. Establish foothold - creating backdoors that allow them to go in and out without detection 
3. Escalate privileges - slowly giving themselves admin accounts to be able to control more 
4. Internal recon - collect info on computer structure, relationships 
5. Move laterally - expand control to other remote computers, networks, servers 
6. Maintain presence - continue to exact control over accounts and computers 
7. Complete mission - remove target info from victim's network

Back to Cozy Bear, this group has been behind many high-profile attacks, most notably the compromise of the Democratics National Committee in 2016, right before the election. They had allegedly broken into the network almost a year prior, silently collecting emails, before distributing to WikiLeaks, who published these 20,000 emails. Something interesting to note is that even though many Democrats have implied Trump and Russia colluded on this infiltration to benefit the candidate, it was actually months before Trump won the Republican nomination. In fact, Russia may not have even been trying to influence the election outcome, they may have just been trying to create confusion and chaos in US politics. 

More recently, Cozy Bear attempted to obtain COVID-19 vaccine data in 2019. In 2021, they breached systems of the Republican National Committee, however the RNC denies this, stating that a Microsoft investigation found that no data had been accessed. The hackers compromised a third-party provider and this provider's accounts were blocked from accessing their cloud environment.
