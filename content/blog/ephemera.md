Definition: items of collectible memorabilia, typically written or printed ones, that were originally expected to have only short-term usefulness or popularity.

In other words, vintage items that were maybe one-time use or not expected to be collectible later. Great examples of ephemera include postage stamps, newspapers, stickers, cigarette boxes, snack wrappers. They serve as a great visual reference to specific time periods and can be used as obscure inspiration for graphic design, marketings, etc.
