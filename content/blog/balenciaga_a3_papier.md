I have a confession: I might (definitely am) addicted to collecting vintage bags. As a way to distract and delay from buying more, I've decided to deep dive and research each one and detail it on lavalamps.

Today I'll be researching my new Balenciaga A3 Papier Tote.

Family: Papier Tote
French for "paper," this line consists of square totes and clutches with "Motorcycle" characteristics like studs and tassels. The A4 is the largest in the Papier family, more rectangular than her sister, the more square-shaped A5.

Serial Number Tag:
After researching online it appears many of the Papier tabs are embossed into the leather with metallic gold finish. The second line on the back of the tab is 515859, signifying the family. An authentic bag online bought in 2011 had metallic embossing and serif font, same as mine.


Color: Gris Poivre, which corresponds to L, which corresponds to Balenciaga's code of S/S 2012.
